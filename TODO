SD - NL robustness
SD - steering robustness
SD - entanglement robustnesses (separable...)
SD - KetSparse (future)
MT - Random Channels, Random Isometries, Random Random (?)
MT - Section for Channels/Superoperators (add Choi map, etc etc)
SD - Properly add measurements/states from https://gitlab.com/tqo/sqma/ (add general 2-designs)
CG - In _dps_constraints! bypass new variables when n = 1, as then only PPT is needed (minor technical issue)
CG - GME detection with DPS
CG - Basic state discrimination stuff
LP - seesaw with fixed state
MA - signalling and non-signalling bounds for Bell inequalities
MA - canonical representation of Bell inequalities
